# Fungi Farm

A quick flat-styled minigame demo, result of a little vanilla JS & CSS exercise.
See it working at [my website](http://dorianm.com/demos/fungi) or at
[GitHub page of this repo](https://featheredsnek.github.io/fungi-js/).

## Background and purpose
You grow, collect and sell mushrooms. Simple as that.
After working for quite a while on another project in Python and C
I wanted to make something pretty with vanilla JS.
As a game it is far from perfect or even usable, as I'm sure that the optimal
stategy could be found in 5 minutes by a human, and it's possible that
mindlessly clicking everything will also lead to the max score.
Still, I think the visuals turned out pretty neat and that it can serve me as
a basis for some more interesting projects.

## How it's made
Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. SVGs made with Inkscape.

## Concluding remarks
Having separated the logic from the visuals, I plan to make some other UIs.
Also, I'd like to find some time to mess around with evolutionary algorithm for
the initial settings and see if it such algorithm would be able to turn this
into an interesting, playable game just by adjusting cost & return values.
